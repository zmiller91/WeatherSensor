/**
 * To get this program to work you have to:
 * 
 * 1. Set the "Reset Oscillator Selection bits" to HFINTOSC (32MHz) in the 
 *    Configuration Bits section of MCC. 
 * 2. Set the "Current Oscillator Souce Select" to "HFINTOSC_32MHz" in Clock Control
 * 3. Set the "HF Internal Clock" to "32_MHz" in Clock Control
 * 4. Increase the power supply voltage to 5.5 in PK0B Nano -> Power section 
 *    of the project properties.
 * 
 * These config changes make it so that the board can power the DHT11 with 
 * sufficient voltage and ensure the MCU is fast enough to recognize the DHT11
 * input pulses. 
 * 
 * This code requires a bit more work to ensure it doesn't get stuck in an 
 * infinite loop.
